  This part of the documentation is deprecated. Several changes are currently perfomed on the library.
  A new stable version of Tubex will be released in the coming weeks.

Introduction
============

Tubex proposes various realistic applications based on the tools provided in this library.

Marine robotics and underwater exploration provide challenging academic problems to work on. This application field motivated the development of tools related to tubes, and then the proposal of such library.


Get ready
---------

Make sure that Tubex and its dependencies are installed on your computer.
You also need the VIBes viewer for visualization. The details are provided in :ref:`sec-installation-label`.

Then, start a new project as explained in :ref:`sec-start-cpp-project-label` or :ref:`sec-start-py-project-label` and verify that it is displaying information about a simple tube in the terminal.
