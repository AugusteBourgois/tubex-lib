Reliable correction of a drifting clock
---------------------------------------

.. The following example is taken from `this paper <http://simon-rohou.fr/research/tubobs/tubobs_paper.pdf>`_.

The following example is taken from the paper `Reliable Non-Linear State Estimation Involving Time Uncertainties`, submitted to Automatica.

Details are coming soon.

To run the example, launch the Vibes viewer and, from a terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

  ./build/examples/cpp/07_drifting_clock/ex_drifting_clock

The sources are available in:

.. code-block:: none

  ./examples/cpp/07_drifting_clock/main.cpp
