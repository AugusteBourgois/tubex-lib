Tubex library
=============


Introduction
------------

Tubex is a C++ library providing tools for computations over sets of trajectories.
It has been designed to deal with **dynamical systems** defined by **non-linear differential equations** and involving constraints such as time uncertainties or **delays**.

The building blocks of this library are *tubes*, that represent domains for **trajectory** variables (*e.g.* signals evolving with time). When a trajectory :math:`x(\cdot)` comes with uncertainties (due to numerical approximations or errors coming from sensors), a reliable enclosure of it can be made thanks to a tube :math:`[x](\cdot)`.

A tube is defined as an interval of two trajectories. Its bounds delineate the **uncertainties** of a dynamical system, thus defining a solution set.
Then, any operation related to :math:`x(\cdot)` will be made on its reliable enclosure :math:`[x](\cdot)`, which allows **guaranteed outputs**. These computations stand on interval analysis, a well suited tool that reliably propagates uncertainties.

**Mobile robotics** has been the initial motivation of this project: the mathematical tools provided in Tubex come together with robotic applications.

Computations stands on the `IBEX library <http://www.ibex-lib.org/>`_ that provides reliable tools for static systems.
