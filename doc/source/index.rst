Tubex library documentation
===========================

Introduction
-------------

*Tubex* is a library providing tools to handle sets of trajectories. 
Computations stands on interval analysis and are, therefore, performed in a guaranteed way.
Functions called *contractors* are available to reduce this sets given several constraints.
Hence, the tubes are well suited to deal with non-linear dynamical systems depicted by differential constraints.

A Python version (`pyIbex <http://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/desrochers/pyibex/>`_ wrapping) is planned.
