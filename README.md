# [Tubex library](http://simon-rohou.fr/research/tubex-lib) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SimonRohou/tubex-lib.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/SimonRohou/tubex-lib)

Tubex is a C++ library providing tools for computations over sets of trajectories.
It has been designed to deal with **dynamical systems** defined by **non-linear differential equations** and involving constraints such as trajectory evaluations, time uncertainties or **delays**.

The building blocks of this library are *tubes*, that represent domains for **trajectory** variables (*e.g.* signals evolving with time). When a trajectory comes with uncertainties (due to numerical approximations or errors coming from sensors), a reliable enclosure of it can be made thanks to a tube.

A tube is defined as an interval of two trajectories. Its bounds delineate the **uncertainties** of a dynamical system, thus defining a solution set.
Then, any operation related to the trajectory will be made on its reliable enclosure, which allows **guaranteed outputs**. These computations stand on interval analysis, a well suited tool that reliably propagates uncertainties.

**Mobile robotics** has been the initial motivation of this project: the mathematical tools provided in Tubex come together with robotic applications.

Computations stands on the [IBEX library](http://www.ibex-lib.org/) that provides reliable tools for static systems.
